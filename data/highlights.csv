"Since sellers tend to transact frequently with multiple buyers and their shipments can be tracked, it’s easy to monitor the repeated behavior of individual sellers to assess their trustworthiness. Buyers, on the other hand, are likely to be much more sporadic with their online activities. Without the capacity to profile any but the worst shopaholics, we had less ability to anticipate the risk on the buying side of the equation.","The PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest of Planet Earth",Eric M.

Ecology also teaches that all life on earth can be viewed as a competition among species for the solar energy captured by green plants and stored in the form of complex carbon molecules.

While modern insurgency and counterinsurgency experts have coined a term for the process—“hearts and minds”—the bare truth is there are no hearts or minds to be won. Instead, the essential focus of civilians caught in a guerrilla war zone is simply to stay alive, and they will cast their lot with whichever side best ensures that—until that side doesn’t anymore, at which point the civilians will move to the other side.","Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East (Ala Notable Books for Adults)",Scott Anderson,B00BH0VSPI,2015-05-29 04:56:00+00:00

While the American president decreed that the Turkish portion of that empire should remain its own sovereign state, “the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.” To Lawrence, as to most other objective readers, that didn’t sound at all like the Sykes-Picot Agreement, nor, for that matter, like the externally imposed Balfour Declaration. In his conversation with William Yale, Lawrence emphasized the enormous esteem in which Arabs of all stripes held the United States. Indeed, so forcefully did Lawrence hit on this note that in his summing up of their conversation for Leland Harrison, Yale noted that the main points “upon which all evidence is agreed, are the distrust of the Arabs in the good faith of England and of France; the opposition to Zionism; and the complete confidence of the Arabs in the United States.”","Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East (Ala Notable Books for Adults)",Scott Anderson,B00BH0VSPI,2015-05-29 04:56:00+00:00

The first 11 positions on the 32-stop virtual reel are mapped to the 11 symbols on the actual reel, but the rest are mapped to blanks, such that the odds of hitting a winning symbol are less than they appear to be. In addition, via a technique called “clustering,” a disproportionate number of virtual stops are mapped to blank spaces just above or below the jackpot symbols.

"It was a small company, owned and operated by one man, and sales were all local, to boaters on the lakes of Minnesota. The owner gave me an annual budget of $25,000 for marketing. I spent it all on one full-page advertisement in Life magazine.” I know that Pitch and I both thought exactly the same thing at that moment: this guy has guts. Our second thought was: and he may be nuts. “How did it work out?” I inquired, trying to disguise my skepticism. “Well,” he replied, “the fact is, I made a lot of money off of that advertisement, and because of it, my wife and I felt uncomfortable in that little middle-class town in Minnesota. So we headed west, and here we are.” He had our attention at this point. “Well, what did you put in the ad?” I asked. He smiled serenely. “I put in a picture of the boat,” he said, “and an application to be a company distributor, along with an order form for one boat at full price. We were deluged with orders, and overnight we had a national distribution network.” “Chuck,” I said, laughing, “how would you like to run a diffusion furnace company?”",The Startup Game: Inside the Partnership between Venture Capitalists and Entrepreneurs,William H.

In contrast, where soils are poor, niche specialists—plants that can thrive within very narrow limits—proliferate, each of which grows best only where specific nutrients are present in specific amounts, and where rain falls at specific times. The best example of this is seen on the infertile sand plains of South Africa’s Cape Province, where 8,000 species of shrubby flowering plants coexist in a mix as diverse as that of most rain forests.",The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth,Tim Flannery,B008RZKO6A,2017-10-29 04:56:00+00:00
"The phenomenon represents the dissolution of a partnership, for the organisms that make up the world’s reefs and atolls are in fact two living things in one. The larger partner in this ecological merger is a pale, sea anemone–like creature known as a polyp. It gains its greenish, red, or purplish hue from a lodger—a type of algae known as zooxanthellae. Under normal circumstances the relationship is a happy, symbiotic one: The coral polyp provides a home and some nourishment to the algae, while the algae provides the polyp with food from photo-synthesis.",The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth,Tim Flannery,B008RZKO6A,2017-10-29 04:56:00+00:00

"Dulles thought that would be the end of the matter, but Nasser responded quickly and boldly. On 26 July 1956, thereafter celebrated as a national holiday in Egypt, he announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal. Egypt would build the High Dam with profits from operating the canal. The British government was outraged, but having withdrawn its last troops from the canal zone a few months earlier, the only thing it could do was to have the Suez Canal Company’s European pilots walk off the job in the expectation that traffic would come to a stop. Instead, the few Egyptian pilots who remained, forty out of a force of more than two hundred, carried on so valiantly that the canal continued to operate. The British prime minister Anthony Eden longed to use force against Egypt, but it took time to move military units into position; besides, there was insufficient justification: the canal was open, the world’s commerce was moving through it, and most nations affirmed the right of a state to nationalize institutions within its borders.

"Personal Histories Exercise In less than an hour, a team can take the first steps toward developing trust. This low-risk exercise requires nothing more than going around the table during a meeting and having team members answer a short list of questions about themselves. Questions need not be overly sensitive in nature and might include the following: number of siblings, hometown, unique challenges of childhood, favorite hobbies, first job, and worst job. Simply by describing these relatively innocuous attributes or experiences, team members begin to relate to one another on a more personal basis, and see one another as human beings with life stories and interesting backgrounds. This encourages greater empathy and understanding, and discourages unfair and inaccurate behavioral attributions.","The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Enhanced Edition: A Leadership Fable (J-B Lencioni Series)",Patrick M.

At the same time, I had to convince an experienced hotel operator to come in with me before I actually had a deal, knowing that such a partner would give me more credibility with the banks when I went to seek financing. And even a great partner wasn’t enough. I also had to try to persuade city officials that it was in their interest to give me a totally unprecedented tax break.

In the meantime, I would put down a nonrefundable $250,000 for an exclusive option. There was just one problem: I wasn’t too eager to fork over even $250,000 on a deal that was still very much a long shot. In 1974, $250,000 was a huge sum of money for me. So I stalled.

Of course, we are hamstrung in this analysis by not knowing what the dark matter is in the first place. If all mass has gravity, does all gravity have mass? We don’t know.

"The crux of the matter was money. Given that customs duties accounted for well over a third of the crown’s income, how was the government to finance the defense of Britain’s vast new conquests, much less pay off the nation’s sky-high war debt, if the colonies continued to flout the law? Increased domestic taxation was next to impossible: the landowning classes refused to accept a higher land tax, while stiffer excises looked very risky in light of widespread industrial and agrarian unrest.

Washington, by contrast, had no ships to speak of and probably fewer than twenty-three thousand men under his command, mostly raw militia without adequate equipment, training, or experience.

All told, the American army had taken a terrible beating trying to hold the city. Some thirty-six hundred men lay dead or wounded, and another four thousand, along with three hundred officers, were prisoners of the enemy. Thousands of others had simply gone home in disgust or despair. Mountains of ammunition and equipment had been lost. This dismal accounting persuaded many army officers and members of Congress to think twice about the best way to carry on the struggle. Lee’s notion of relying on militia and home-grown amateur officers seemed discredited; Washington, among others, now believed the Revolution wouldn’t survive unless Congress created a standing army of regular, professional troops who obeyed their officers, held their ground under fire, and didn’t head for home whenever they wanted (to which Henry Knox added pleas for a military academy to provide the army with proper officers).",Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (The History of NYC Series),Edwin G.

The total—nearly eighty million dollars—was the country’s “price of liberty,” Hamilton said. Yet, he added, neither the old Confederation nor many of the states had fulfilled their duty to pay off this sacred debt as promised. The annual revenues of the new federal government weren’t even enough to cover the interest on the debt (currently around $4 million a year), let alone retire the principal, and numerous public creditors had been waiting for their money for years.

The Arab provinces of North Africa were far from the Ottoman center of gravity and, in the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, had become increasingly autonomous of Istanbul.

"For Egypt, the Suez Crisis was the classic example of a military defeat turned to a political victory. Nasser’s bold rhetoric and defiance were not matched by any military accomplishments. The very act of survival was deemed a major political victory, and the Egyptians—and Nasser’s mass following across the Arab world—celebrated as though Nasser had in fact defeated Egypt’s enemies.

"Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio. Through the Voice of the Arabs, he was able to pressure other Arab rulers to toe his line, bypassing the heads of Arab governments to address their citizens directly. In a political report on the situation in Lebanon in 1957, the director of intelligence in Lebanon, Amir Farid Chehab, wrote: “Political propaganda in Nasser’s favour is what mostly occupies the spirit of the Muslim masses who consider him the only leader of the Arabs.

"The more powerful the storm, the farther the swell may travel. As it travels, it becomes more organized—the distance between each wave in a train, known as the interval, becomes uniform. In a long-interval train, the orbiting water may extend more than a thousand feet beneath the ocean surface.

"As waves from a swell approach a shoreline, their lower ends begin to feel the sea bottom. Wave trains become sets—groups of waves that are larger and have a longer interval than their locally generated cousins. The approaching waves refract (bend) in response to the shape of the sea bottom. The visible part of the wave grows. The resistance offered by the sea bottom increases as the water gets shallower, slowing the progress of the lowest part of the wave. The wave above the surface steepens.

Dances usually have symbolic dimensions that are part of their image and popularity. The englische contra dance had uniquely progressive implications.

"The prospect of having to earn a living as purely a freelance composer may have frightened him, as it should have. Bach, Mozart, Haydn—none of them had lived mainly on their earnings as a composer. He could sell anything he wrote, but the fees were small.

"The Second Symphony is an extravagantly comic piece, but there had been one private joke in the course of the program. Beethoven had not had time to write down the piano part of the Third Concerto before the concert—only the orchestral parts. So the solo music existed only in his head, to be fleshed out with improvisation en route. No one in those days publicly played from memory. Beethoven arrived onstage, took his bow, sat down at the piano, and placed a sheaf of music on the stand. Young conductor Ignaz von Seyfried, who had helped out through the marathon rehearsal, was the designated page-turner. When Beethoven opened the solo part, Seyfried discovered that the pages were largely full of empty measures, with only a few “Egyptian hieroglyphs” to remind the composer of passages.",Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph,Jan Swafford,B00E78IB3E,2020-03-16 04:56:00+00:00
"The main connection between C minor and E major is A-flat/G-sharp, the note singled out by the winds at the beginning of the concerto.

"For Beethoven the process is harder than for most creators, because he demands that every idea has to submit to the plan, to leading motives of pitch and rhythm, the character, flow, key scheme, harmony.

Nonetheless, work on the Bonaparte proceeds fast.",Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph,Jan Swafford,B00E78IB3E,2020-03-16 04:56:00+00:00
"New Path as confirm and epitomize it. What did the New Path, his full maturity, amount to? In the long view, it was no complete departure. Rather, he took up his boldest and most personal mode, heard in the Pathétique and the op. 31 Sonatas, among other works, as his essential voice.

"lay. He could shape a gripping dramatic line in a string quartet or a piano sonata, but the pacing and the arc of a story in words and actions onstage were nearly a closed book to him.

"He will place himself above everyone else and become a tyrant!” He snatched up the title page of the symphony, ripped it in two, and threw it to the floor.32 If that was said and done as Ries remembered it years later, Beethoven was correct in every respect. In his response, the news hit him in terms of ideals and history. He understood that now the revolutionary dreams of the 1780s were finished, because Napoleon had been the only man able to realize them. The Revolution is dead; long live the Revolution. But of course, Beethoven did not throw out the Third Symphony. When the parts were published in 1806, the title would read Sinfonia eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d’un grand’uomo: “Heroic symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.” It was a finely considered title.

"The later eighteenth century integrated that model with sonata form, creating a hybrid we call sonata-rondo. One common outline for it is ABACABA.

Those more than half million fatalities in Africa far exceed any reasonable estimate of what Ebola could have caused in the 2014 outbreak.

"In fact, the idea of a “total book” has a much longer history.

Denis Diderot explicitly regarded his Encyclopédie, published between 1751 and 1772, as a safe repository of human knowledge, preserving it for posterity in case of a cataclysm that snuffs our civilization as the ancient cultures of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had all been lost, leaving behind only random surviving fragments of their writing.

"According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, the state with the highest murder rate in 2014 was Louisiana, with 10.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. No other state had a rate of 10 or more. Puerto Rico’s murder rate was 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, surpassing the District of Columbia, with 15.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Murder rates were even higher in the San Juan metropolitan area, which recorded the highest figure in the United States in 2014 (23.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants). One of the major reasons for Puerto Rico’s high crime rate has been the increase in drug trafficking and drug addiction since the 1970s.

"Opinion-driven: You have to follow your gut and your vision for what you want to do, without the benefit of sufficient data to guide you or back you up. These decisions are always hard and always questioned—after all, everyone has an opinion. Every decision has elements of data and opinion, but they are ultimately driven by one or the other. Sometimes you have to double down on the data; other times you have to look at all the data and then trust your gut. And trusting your gut is incredibly scary. Many people don’t have either a good gut instinct to follow or the faith in themselves to follow it. It takes time to develop that trust. So they try to turn an opinion-driven business decision into a data-driven one. But data can’t solve an opinion-based problem. So no matter how much data you get, it will always be inconclusive. This leads to analysis paralysis—death by overthinking. If you don’t have enough data to make a decision, you’ll need insights to inform your opinion. Insights can be key learnings about your customers or your market or your product space—something substantial that gives you an intuitive feeling for what you should do.",Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making,Tony Fadell,B09BNJ6GBV,2022-06-13 04:56:00+00:00

"And so the year began, with an outward sense of better times ahead and, for the Dodds, a fresh round of parties and banquets.

Musk turned to his security guard and asked to borrow his pocket knife. Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the floor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then crawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy open an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited to see what happened. Nothing exploded.

"In 1768–71, James Cook first beat scurvy on a long voyage by the regular issue of the proper anti-scorbutics. By then, it was known to be a dietary problem. Dr. James Lind, in 1753, had hit on the right cure: a daily dose of citrus juice. Yet neither Cook (who always worried about the health of his crew) nor the officers of the Admiralty’s Victualling Board read Lind’s treatise, and instead of citrus juice Cook tried other anti-scorbutics: sauerkraut, malt, and half a ton of “portable soup,” made by boiling down meat broth into a gummy cake, the ancestor of the bouillon cube. In combination, these worked. Throughout the three-year voyage of the Endeavour, Cook did not lose a man from scurvy—a feat without precedent in the history of seafaring. Malt-juice and pickled cabbage put Europeans in Australia, as microchip circuitry would put Americans on the moon.",The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding,Robert Hughes,B006NKL884,2015-10-21 04:56:00+00:00
"By Cook’s time, there were two systems of finding longitude. Both relied on the fact that as the earth spins, local time alters from place to place—thus, when it is noon in London, it is 7 a.m. in New York. The Earth rotates once a day; and as there are 24 hours in a day and 360 degrees of longitude around the equator, an hour’s difference in time represented a shift of 15 degrees in longitude. So if one knew when and at what angle a given astronomical event would be seen at Greenwich, and observed it from, say, a spot in the Pacific at that same angle, the difference in hours multiplied by 15 would yield the longitude in degrees. This constant was the angle between the moon or sun and a fixed star, such as Polaris, and was known as “lunar distance.”",The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding,Robert Hughes,B006NKL884,2015-10-21 04:56:00+00:00

The wine’s carbon dioxide also accentuates the acidic impression in the mouth. But the wine’s sweetness counterbalances its acidity and vice versa. Depending on the actual amount of sugar and the particular acid/sugar balance a sparkling wine strikes, the wine may taste dry, very slightly sweet, medium sweet, or quite sweet.",Wine For Dummies,Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan,B008KPM0G4,2016-02-24 04:56:00+00:00

Himmler kept his vial of potassium cyanide concealed in a cavity of his gums.

On the edge of the blades they welded the high-carbon steel, which was brittle but extremely hard and could therefore be made very sharp. By using the sharp high-carbon steel as a wrapper on top of the tough low-carbon steel they achieved what many thought impossible: a sword that could survive impact with other swords and armor",Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World,Mark Miodownik,B00E78IFV2,2016-05-10 04:56:00+00:00

"Accidentally, by getting the ratios of two alloy ingredients right, carbon and chromium, he had managed to create a very special crystal structure in which the chromium and carbon atoms were both inserted inside the iron crystals. The addition of chromium had not made the steel harder, hence he had rejected the sample, but it had done something much more interesting. Normally when steel is exposed to air and water, the iron on the surface reacts to form iron(III) oxide, a red mineral commonly known as rust. When this rust flakes off, it exposes another layer of the steel to further corrosion, which is what makes rusting such a chronic problem for steel structures, hence the need to paint steel bridges and cars.

"every hundred years, during which Mercury travels a radial journey of 36,000 degrees, the perihelion of its orbit shifts about 1/10,000th beyond its appointed destination, an error of just 38 arcseconds per century. Tiny, yes. But the excess perihelion advance of Mercury retained one crucial property: it wasn’t zero. Le Verrier knew what such unreconciled motion must mean. If Mercury moved where no known mass existed to push it, then there was some “imperfection of our knowledge” waiting to be repaired.","The Hunt for Vulcan: . . .

"Common sense says that energy is something that happens to matter, the strike of a bat on a ball or the explosion that throws a shell out the cannon’s mouth. But common sense is wrong. Einstein’s equation forces us to conceive of matter and energy as intertwined, capable of transforming, one into the other.","The Hunt for Vulcan: . . .

"Free fall produces the same experience as the weightlessness of empty space, far from any source of gravity; acceleration produces the identical perception—that of weight—as does standing still in the grip of the earth’s gravitational field.

"Now imagine the rocket takes off, accelerating as it goes. The craft moves just a little in the time light takes to travel from one side of the compartment to the other. As the rocket moves, that flash strikes the far wall just a little lower than the point at which it entered through the window. To an observer within the rocket, light is bending, actually curving downward. Accelerate more, and each ray of light bends more sharply. That’s under acceleration—and if you accept the equivalence principle, then, as acceleration bends light, so must gravity.","The Hunt for Vulcan: . . .

"Let me emphasize that point. Within many sets of plausible future options, the status quo is often the simplest and most likely option. Thus, my habit of using simple and likely values will tend to make my baseline scenario more like the status quo, and less strange than what the future is likely to be. But as we can’t say much about in which specific directions reality is likely to be strange, this baseline scenario still seems our best reference for calculating concrete future details.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00

"Brain emulation is more like porting software from one machine to another machine. To port software, one need only write software for the new machine that allows that machine to emulate the machine language of the old machine. One need not understand how the software that one has ported works; it can be an opaque black box. Standard AI software, in contrast, is more like writing a new software system for the new machine, inspired by seeing what software can do on the old machine.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"The brain may have up to 10 times as many other relevant cells. This strongly suggests that there will be a wide range of speeds at which one can make ems run faster just by adding more devices, implying that the costs of em hardware are roughly proportional to speed over this wide range.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"To interact naturally and flexibly, a pair of ems needs matching speeds, periods, and phases.

"For example, if there were an algorithm that could compute a neuron firing in 10 000 of these fastest-known circuit cycles, then an emulation based on this algorithm would run a million times faster than the human brain. As quite complex parallel computer programs can be run in 10 000 cycles, em speedups of at least one million times seem feasible, provided that energy and cooling are cheap enough to profitably allow the use of these fastest electronic circuits. When energy and cooling are more strongly limiting factors, however, the top cheap speed could be slower.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"For example, sticks twice as long take twice as much time to complete each oscillation.

"When the hardware supporting two em brains is far enough apart in space relative to their speeds, however, communication delays become noticeable.

"As cooling tends to require more space than does energy generation and transport, most of the space devoted to energy and cooling is likely devoted to cooling. Thus in em cities densely packed with computer hardware, a substantial fraction (likely 20-70%) of em city volume is devoted to cooling pipes.

"it may become possible to send cheaper-to-compute higher-level signals that em brains interpret as their having seen the lower-level signals.

"The more the em world focuses on how things look in virtual reality, the less that ems are willing to pay to make things look nice in physical reality. In addition, the em world in general focuses more on functionality relative to design and aesthetics. Thus in the physical world em buildings and other infrastructure tends to look functional, and perhaps harsh. But virtual reality is usually quite comfortable.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Even non-retired non-spur ems who run at the same speed can still differ in status. So there may be views that hide lower status ems, and only show higher status ems. This could be similar to how today servants such as waiters often try to seem invisible, and are often treated by those they serve as if invisible.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Ems also typically want to see the voice tone, facial expressions, and gaze directions of themselves and their current interaction partners, and to know if they are seeing or showing direct and unfiltered versions of these tones and expressions.

"Another approach to noticing sims is to watch for simulation errors, that is, ways that a simulation deviates from a realistic world. But if sim creators saw that a participant em had noticed an error, they could just stop and reverse the simulation back to a time before the error appeared, restart the simulation at that point, and try to prevent the error.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"When the original em has a strict veto on the copy process, so that copies don’t happen without the consent of the original, ems would feel a much stronger ownership of their existence than do humans today. In this case, ems likely feel less justified in complaining about features of their situation that were easy to anticipate when they agreed to make a copy of themselves. Ems may also feel more obliged to be grateful to those who enabled their existence, and to make good on the promises, both explicit and implicit, that they made to such enablers. Ems can more see themselves as justifying and paying for their existence, via the benefits that others expected to gain by creating and hiring them.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Authorities might try to control computing hardware by controlling the communication channels that such hardware uses to gain value. For example, authorities might try to ensure that they know the location and function of all high-bandwidth nodes in a communication network. This approach might be evaded, however, by illicit direct laser links between distant physical locations, or by physical landlines deep underground. Authorities might also try to inspect all communication traffic, and prevent unauthorized encrypted communication.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Em minds age with experience, becoming less flexible and thus less able to adapt to new skills and environments. Because of this, old ems eventually become substantially less productive than young competitors, and need to retire.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"A similar effect causes large software systems to “rot” with time. As software that was designed to match one set of tasks, tools, and situations is slowly changed to deal with a steady stream of new tasks, tools, and situations, such software becomes more complex, fragile, and more difficult to usefully change (Lehman and Belady 1985). Eventually it is better to start over and write whole new subsystems, and sometimes whole new systems, from scratch.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
"For example, as a milli-em experiences roughly an hour in 1 objective month, then in an economy that doubles every objective month the cost of retiring indefinitely at a milli-em speed is the cost to run an em for about 1 subjective hour. Alternatively, for a retirement speed 10 times slower, and an economic doubling time of 10 days, the cost to retire falls to the cost to run an em for 2 subjective minutes. It only costs 1 subjective second of high speed experience to retire indefinitely at micro-em speeds. Thus indefinite retirement can be quite cheap, even for ems who work for only a short time before retiring.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00

"Slow em retirees share many features with people we see as “less alive,” including ghosts. Not only are they literally closer subjectively to dying because of civilization instability, their minds are also more inflexible and stuck in their ways. Compared with faster working ems, slow retirees have less awareness, wealth, status, and influence, and they are slower to respond to events, including via speaking words or coordinating with others.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00

"A more relaxed attitude toward “death” might be helped by the fact that em endings rarely have to be a surprise. Today, the timings of deaths are usually disruptive surprises, causing many to be highly stressed in anticipation. For ems, in contrast, the timing of their endings could usually be chosen and known, and thus could be made more convenient. On the other hand, some ems might be less stressed overall not knowing the exact moment of their ending. Such ems might be very stressed by knowing they are in their last few minutes, but far less stressed knowing they are in their last week.","The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Robin Hanson,B01FHNFAVS,2016-06-24 04:56:00+00:00
Having em wages near subsistence levels should eliminate most of the profits that might be gained by enslaving ems. History shows that slave owners are the most eager to create and own slaves when wages are high and rising.

"After all, workers tend to leave organizations that focus on negatives. More competitive em organizations, in contrast, are likely to focus more on negatives than we do today.

Attention is sufficient. But when things do happen, they often happen very quickly, placing a premium on preexisting networks and information. “Windows of opportunity” are rare in politics, and they must be seized on when they do occur.13 As we will see later, informing clients and bosses about developments in Washington is a key part of what lobbyists do.

"“The first thing they’d always say was, ‘Of course we know people make mistakes every now and then, but the mistakes are random, and they’ll wash out in the market,’” recalled Thaler. Thaler no longer believed that. His list, and the impulse to create it, did not win him friends in the University of Rochester’s Department of Economics, or its business school. “He had enemies and he’s not awfully good at mollifying enemies,” said Tom Russell, a fellow economics professor at Rochester. “If you tell an academic to his face, ‘You’ve just said something really stupid’—okay, the big ones might say, ‘How is it stupid?,’ but the little ones just store it.” The University of Rochester denied Thaler tenure. His future was hazy when, in 1976, he attended a conference on how to value a human life. When he heard of Thaler’s curious interests, another conference attendee suggested that Thaler read Kahneman and Tversky’s article in Science that sought to explain why people did stupid things. Thaler went home and found “Judgment Under Uncertainty” in an old copy of Science. He couldn’t believe his own excitement as he read it. He went and pulled all the other articles in other publications written by Kahneman and Tversky. “I have vivid memories of running from one article to another,” says Thaler. “As if I have discovered the secret pot of gold. For a while I wasn’t sure why I was so excited. Then I realized: They had one idea. Which was systematic bias.” If people could be systematically wrong, their mistakes couldn’t be ignored. The irrational behavior of the few would not be offset by the rational behavior of the many. People could be systematically wrong, and so markets could be systematically wrong, too. Thaler got someone to send him a draft of “Value Theory.” He instantly saw it for what it was, a truck packed with psychology that might be driven into inner sanctums of economics and exploded. The logic in the paper was awesome, overpowering. What soon would be known as prospect theory explained most of the items on Thaler’s list, in a language economists could understand. There were items on Thaler’s list that prospect theory did not address—self-control was the big one—but that didn’t matter. The paper blew a hole in economic theory for psychology to enter. “That really is the magic of the paper,” said Thaler, “showing you could do it. Math with psychology in it. That paper was what an economist would call proof of existence. It captured so much of human nature.”",The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds,Michael Lewis,B01GI6S7EK,2017-01-03 04:56:00+00:00

"Here is a related but starker moral question. Take a powerful computer and set each bit randomly to 0 or 1 using a quantum randomizer. (That means that 0 and 1 occur in histories of equal measure.) At that point all possible contents of the computer’s memory exist in the multiverse. So there are necessarily histories present in which the computer contains an AI program – indeed, all possible AI programs in all possible states, up to the size that the computer’s memory can hold. Some of them are fairly accurate representations of you, living in a virtual-reality environment crudely resembling your actual environment. (Present-day computers do not have enough memory to simulate a realistic environment accurately, but, as I said in Chapter 7, I am sure that they have more than enough to simulate a person.) There are also people in every possible state of suffering. So my question is: is it wrong to switch the computer on, setting it executing all those programs simultaneously in different histories? Is it, in fact, the worst crime ever committed? Or is it merely inadvisable, because the combined measure of all the histories containing suffering is very tiny?

Each corps was effectively a mini-army, with its own infantry, cavalry, artillery, staff, intelligence, engineering, transport, victualling, pay, medical and commissary sections, intended to work in close connection with other corps. Moving within about one day’s march of each other, they allowed Napoleon to swap around the rearguard, vanguard or reserve at a moment’s notice, depending on the movements of the enemy. So, in either attack or retreat, the whole army could pivot on its axis without confusion.

One major problem with the Continental System was that it could not be imposed universally. In 1807, for example, because Hamburg and the Hanseatic towns such as Lübeck, Lüneburg, Rostock, Stralsund and Bremen couldn’t manufacture the 200,000 pairs of shoes, 50,000 greatcoats, 37,000 vests and so on that the Grande Armée required, their governors were forced to buy them from British manufacturers under special licences allowing them through the blockade. Many of Napoleon’s soldiers in the coming battles of the Polish campaign wore uniforms made in Halifax and Leeds, and British ministers boasted in the House of Commons that Napoleon couldn’t even provide the insignia stitched onto his officers’ uniforms except by resort to British manufacturers.34 In some parts of the Empire, the Continental System caused genuine distress as it unbalanced, dislocated and occasionally wrecked entire",Napoleon: A Life,Andrew Roberts,B00INIXLPW,2017-10-19 04:56:00+00:00

Napoleon suspected that the last two opposed the Austrian marriage only because they had voted for the execution of Marie Louise’s great-aunt, Marie Antoinette.

"A few hundred resurrections, a few hundred different delusions of extortion, a few hundred deaths. I didn’t care – the notion was far too bizarre, far too alien to move me – which was probably why there hadn’t been a very different ransom demand: “We have your Copy…” And the fake Loraine – not even a Copy of the real woman, but a construct based entirely on my knowledge of her, my memories, my mental images – what empathy, what loyalty, what love did I owe her? The kidnappers might not have fully reproduced the memory-resurrection technique invented in the Island.

"I thought: if hearing that makes me feel strange and giddy, how must it make the jewel feel? Exactly the same, I reasoned; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel, it too reasons: “Exactly the same; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel…” And it too wonders— (I knew, because I wondered) — it too wonders whether it’s the real me, or whether in fact it’s only the jewel that’s learning to be me.",Axiomatic,Greg Egan,B00FDWOBZA,2020-07-02 04:56:00+00:00

"The brain couldn’t simply be transplanted into the clone, like a heart or a kidney. The peripheral nervous system of the new body wasn’t identical to that of the old one; identical genes weren’t sufficient to ensure that. Also – despite drugs to limit the effect – parts of Chris’s brain had atrophied slightly from disuse. So, rather than splicing nerves directly between the imperfectly matched brain and body – which probably would have left him paralyzed, deaf, dumb and blind – the impulses would be routed through a computerized “interface,” which would try to sort out the discrepancies.

"No windows, one door without a handle. Set into the wall beside the bed, a full-length mirror. I stood a while and stared at my ridiculous form. It suddenly occurred to me that, if Bentley had a real love of symmetry games, he might have built one room as the mirror image of the other, modified the HV set accordingly, and altered one jewel, one copy of me, to exchange right for left.

"At one time Salesforce.com was the disrupter in the sales force automation industry. Now it has become the de facto standard. When this happens, the cost of sales goes way down, and the leverage on incremental R&D to support any given customer goes way up. That’s one of the reasons pragmatists make such a great market.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"Pragmatists want to buy from proven market leaders because they know that third parties will design supporting products around a market-leading product. That is, market-leading products create an aftermarket that other vendors service. This radically reduces pragmatist customers’ burden of support. By contrast, if they mistakenly choose a product that does not become the market leader, but rather one of the also-rans, then this highly valued aftermarket support does not develop, and they will be stuck making all the enhancements by themselves. Market leadership is crucial, therefore, to winning pragmatist customers.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"Finally, there is a third compelling reason to be niche focused when crossing the chasm, which has to do with the need to achieve market leadership.

"Why is this important? Well, software programs at the application layer are “naturally vertical” because they directly interface with end users, and end users organize themselves by geography, industry, and profession. This makes them readily adaptable to the beachhead focus needed to cross the chasm. Later on in the life cycle, however, as solutions generalize, a horizontal approach is typically more productive, but this is a much harder challenge for an application offer to meet.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"The problem they were addressing was, quite simply, making the quarter. Unlike the incumbent sales automation packages, which were sold to enterprise executives to help them with budgeting and forecasting, Salesforce was designed first and foremost to help the salespeople themselves, giving them and their managers direct visibility into their pipelines, showing exactly what stage each prospect was in, alerting them to actions they could take to move it to the next stage. Unlike their competitors, which demanded significant effort to be kept up to date but gave little back in the way of day-to-day","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"Finally, because software-as-a-service is sold as a subscription, it was very much in Salesforce’s interests to keep customers using the product, and since they ran the product themselves, they could see who was and who wasn’t using it, and focus their support efforts accordingly. By contrast, while the packaged software vendors had sold all-you-can-eat enterprise-wide license agreements, many were in fact going unused, and no one was terribly incented to do anything about it. As a result, wherever Salesforce landed, it tended to expand, relatively unopposed.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"And because all their industries were U.S.-centered and “tech savvy,” and because salespeople tend to job hop more than other professions, there was plenty of cross-pollination to help spread the demand virally.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"At this point, people normally think that bigger is better. But in fact, this is almost never the case. Here’s why. To become a going concern, a persistent entity in the market, you need a market segment that will commit to you as its de facto standard for enabling a critical business process. To become that de facto standard, you need to win at least half, and preferably a lot more, of the new orders in the segment over the next year. That is the sort of vendor performance that causes pragmatist customers to sit up and take notice. At the same time, you will still be taking orders from other segments. So do the math.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"It also means that same $5 million has to represent at least half of the total orders from the segment if you are to have the desired market-leader impact. In other words, if you are going to be a $10 million company next year you do not want to attack a segment larger than $10 million. At the same time, it should be large enough to generate your $5 million. So the rules of thumb in crossing the chasm are simple: Big enough to matter, small enough to lead, good fit with your crown jewels.","Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)",Geoffrey A.

"Something similar happened with the grassy wildflower known as flax. In the wild, flax seedpods burst open when ripe and drop their tiny seeds on the ground, where they’re nearly impossible to collect. Early farmers collected the pods from the rare plants on which they remained closed. Like blue eyes, these intact capsules express a recessive genetic trait, so seeds from them produce offspring whose seedpods also stay closed.

"A much better approach is for the more senior person to escalate to even more senior leaders. Controversial decisions need to be escalated quickly. You can’t let two junior people argue for a year and exhaust themselves. You have to teach those junior people. When your team is really at loggerheads, escalate—and escalate fast. And then you, as the more senior person, hear the various points of view, and you say, “Look, none of us knows what the right decision is here, but I want you to gamble with me.

"The explanation for the fact that mixing colored light makes white, while mixing colored paint makes black, lies in the science of optics. Essentially, there are two different types of color mixing: additive and subtractive. With additive mixing, different light wavelengths are combined to create different colors, and when added together the result is white light. This is what Newton demonstrated with his prisms. However, the opposite happens when paints are mixed. Since each pigment only reflects back to the eye a proportion of the available light, when several are mixed together more and more wavelengths are subtracted. Mix enough together and very little of the visible spectrum is reflected, so we will perceive the mixture to be black, or very close to it.",The Secret Lives of Color,Kassia St Clair,B01MSCJNN8,2020-12-22 04:56:00+00:00
"The more colors they blend, the more likely it is that the end result will be murky. But the same is true even for simple colors like green and orange: it’s better to use a single pigment rather than mixtures that will inevitably absorb more of the available light wavelengths, sucking the luminosity from the painting.

All this helped to reassure whites that, whatever faults they possessed, South Africa had a rightful place in the Western camp.

Lay the paper on the board. Pin the ends of the string down through the paper, being careful to leave some slack. Then pull the string taut with the pencil to form an angle, as shown below.

"People lived not as individuals but as parts of wider social estates, each of which came with its own set of privileges and prohibitions.

"Typically, awakened Czechs announced their new status by changing their names to ones that sounded more Slavic: Barbaras became Boženas and Benedikts became Blahoslavs. Thus rechristened into Slavdom, they were ready to fight for the nation, one journal article and ode at a time. For the Eastern European language revivalists, the forms of writing mattered as much as the content. Throughout the region, almost every nation-in-utero devised new scripts and new ways of spelling to differentiate themselves from their oppressors.

"Lithuanians saw the same Czech letters—č, š, ž—that Kopitar thundered against as agents of emancipation. In 1877 the Lithuanian priest Kazimieras Jaunius declared that he would create a Lithuanian script to replace the Polish Latin and Russian Cyrillic alphabets. He began by vowing to never use sz or ż ever again, for as he wrote, “these two letters are Polish, and in our orthography there should not be even the smallest trace of Polish.”[8] Replacing w and ż with the functionally identical v and ž did not noticeably improve the readability of written Lithuanian.

"After debating in print, Kahneman invited me to meet and discuss matters further. I also arranged for him to visit megaproject planners so he could study their experiences firsthand. Eventually each of us came to accept the other’s position: psychology for me and politics for Kahneman.[7] Which factor is most important depends on the character of decisions and projects. In Kahneman’s laboratory experiments, the stakes are low. There is typically no jockeying for position, no competition for scarce resources, no powerful individuals or organizations, no politics of any kind. The closer a project is to that situation, the more individual psychology will dominate, which is what Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and other behavioral scientists have found. But as projects get bigger and decisions more consequential, the influence of money and power grows. Powerful individuals and organizations make the decisions, the number of stakeholders increases, they lobby for their specific interests, and the name of the game is politics. And the balance shifts from psychology to strategic misrepresentation.","How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors That Determine the Fate of Every Project, from Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between",Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner,B0B3HS4C98,2024-02-12 04:56:00+00:00

"“Just do it!”—that is seemingly applicable in all situations. “When we surveyed participants in our executive education classes, we found that managers feel more productive executing tasks than planning them,” observed business professors Francesca Gino and Bradley Staats. “Especially when under time pressure, they perceive planning to be wasted effort.”[22] To put that in more general behavioral terms, people in power, which includes executives deciding about big projects, prefer to go with the quick flow of availability bias, as opposed to the slow effort of planning.[23] Executives everywhere will recognize that attitude.","How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors That Determine the Fate of Every Project, from Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between",Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner,B0B3HS4C98,2024-02-12 04:56:00+00:00

"Cahill rushed the process. He decreed that construction would start in February 1959, whatever the state of planning. Not coincidentally, an election was due in March 1959. He even instructed his officials to start building and “make such progress that no one who succeeds me can stop this.”[8] It was the “start digging a hole” strategy discussed in chapter 2.

What is more, it does it in a democratic manner, meaning that everyone can recreate (up to a certain point) their strata according to their dreams – and this brings a new kind of anxiety, that of freedom.

When the Kingsland Dam opened, three miles below Titusville, enough water had been released to cause the creek to rise two feet or more. A fresh breeze would announce the approaching flood.

As that market glutted, coal prices plummeted. “Between long adits, and wet pits, and hostmen’s monopolies,”II Galloway writes of a slightly earlier period, “not to speak of the primitive methods of conveying coal both underground and on the surface then in vogue, the lessees of collieries seem to have been in quite a sorry plight.”",Energy: A Human History,Richard Rhodes,B075RVX2N3,2024-04-15 04:56:00+00:00

"The entire silo went up, some forty-five hundred metric tons of fertilizer. The force of the blast was hard to gauge; one estimate put it around that of a small atomic bomb. While Bosch recovered, the company totaled up the damages: 561 workers dead, 1,700 injured, around 7,000 homeless, and half a billion marks in repairs to the plant.","The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish Genius, a Doomed Tycoon, and the Discovery That Changed the Course of History",Thomas Hager (Goodreads Author),B001EUGCTS,2024-07-27 04:56:00+00:00
"The Germans had stopped paying reparations, the Weimar government said, as a matter of survival. The nation had been hit during the early 1920s with one fiscal crisis after another, and as part of a short-term solution had made the mistake of printing a great deal of money. The flood of paper marks kicked off a period of hyperinflation in the early 1920s during which the value of the mark plummeted so far, so fast that during the worst of it the mark essentially lost all value.","The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish Genius, a Doomed Tycoon, and the Discovery That Changed the Course of History",Thomas Hager (Goodreads Author),B001EUGCTS,2024-07-27 04:56:00+00:00

"Then the bottom dropped out. In the late 1920s a new oil field was found in Oklahoma. As oil prospectors swarmed to the area, it quickly became clear that it was bigger than anything they had ever seen. What they had found was only the edge of a huge deposit, an underground lake of oil. No, more than a lake. It was a sea of oil. By 1930 oil wells were sprouting across six states, all the way across Texas and into Louisiana. There were sudden fortunes, the rise of the Texas Oilman, and stories of yesterday’s penniless Indians driving Cadillacs. Amid all the excitement came a deeper realization: There was not going to be a worldwide oil shortage. Gasoline, instead of selling for a dollar a gallon (as a U.S. senator had predicted a few years earlier), was as low as nine cents a gallon.","The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish Genius, a Doomed Tycoon, and the Discovery That Changed the Course of History",Thomas Hager (Goodreads Author),B001EUGCTS,2024-07-27 04:56:00+00:00
"Haber was torn. Part of him hoped that the madness would blow over, that the German people would not stand for it, that Hitler’s government would see sense. Didn’t the Nazis realize that forcing out Jewish researchers would gut Germany’s science programs? Jewish scientists were simply too successful, too integral to Germany’s international eminence. How could they be told to leave without doing irreparable damage? How could the Nazis throw away a century of achievement? It was beyond belief. It was madness.

"IT HAPPENED AS Bosch predicted: On May 12, 1944, the sky above his machine-city blackened and filled with airplanes. The U.S. Eighth Air Force had sent 220 bombers and their fighter escorts to destroy Leuna. Bosch’s dream factory was now three square miles in size and thirty-five thousand workers strong.

"Still, the demand for their products is so great that Haber-Bosch plants today consume 1 percent of all the energy on earth, and the largest factories produce so much ammonia that it has to be transported in pipelines (one of the first ammonia pipelines in the United States, built in the late 1960s, for instance, runs from the plant in Texas to the corn fields of Iowa).","The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish Genius, a Doomed Tycoon, and the Discovery That Changed the Course of History",Thomas Hager (Goodreads Author),B001EUGCTS,2024-07-27 04:56:00+00:00
"What is known is that nitrogen pollution in the water ends up feeding blooms of algae and weeds that turn waterways green and cloudy. It can get so bad that it cuts off sun reaching the depths, killing life below. As the vegetation dies and rots, it pulls oxygen out of the water. As oxygen levels go down, bottom-dwelling animals, shellfish and mollusks, begin to die off. The animals that feed on them starve. Toxins begin to collect.

"British trading companies were more successful with tea than with coffee. Tea had been introduced to the British consumer market after coffee, and it was initially more expensive, for the tea trade was controlled by the Dutch, who used their island colony of Java as a transshipment point.23 But then, in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, the British East India Company at last gained access to Chinese ports, and cheap tea flooded the British market.

"Before there was a canal cut across the Central American isthmus, San Francisco importers and roasters struggled to compete with New York, New Orleans, and European ports for a share of the Atlantic trade. They enjoyed privileged access to coffees from the Pacific coast of Latin America, but these coffees did not show well by the standard of handsomeness in the hand.
